# Goals of this file 

1. Use raw fastq files and generate quality plots to assess quality of reads.
2. filter and trim out bad sequences and bases from our sequencing files. 
3. Write out fastq files with high quality sequences. 
4. Evaluate the quaity from our filter and trim 

```{r}
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

#devtools::install_github("benjjneb/dada2")
library(dada2)
```


# Load Data 
```{r load-data}
# set the raw fastq path to the raw sequences files 
# Path to the fastq files
raw_fastqs_path <- "data/01_DADA2/01_raw_gzipped_fastqs"
raw_fastqs_path

# What files are in this path? 
list.files(raw_fastqs_path)

#How many files are there?
str(list.files(raw_fastqs_path))

# Create a vector of forward reads 
forward_reads <- list.files(raw_fastqs_path, pattern = "R1_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)
head(forward_reads)

# Create a vector of reverse reads
reverse_reads <- list.files(raw_fastqs_path, pattern = "R2_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)
head(reverse_reads)
```

# Quality Plots 
```{r raw-quality-plot}
# Randomly select 2 samples from dataset to evaluate 
random_samples <- sample(1:length(reverse_reads), size = 2)
random_samples 

# Calculate and Plot quality if these two samples 
plotQualityProfile(forward_reads[random_samples])
plotQualityProfile(reverse_reads[random_samples]) #the chemistry on the reverse read is not as precises as the forward reads, so the reverse reads will be lower quality
```
